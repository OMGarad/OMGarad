### Hello there!ðŸ‘‹

I am Omkar Garad, a 1st-year master's student currently studying at Cornell University. I am pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems with a concentration in Health Tech.

I am extremely interested in the intersection of NLP and the biomedical domain where I have conducted most of my research. Eventually, I want to design computer applications with a people-first mindset to help catalyze their adoption, especially in the domain of healthcare.

I hope you enjoy looking at my repositories!!
